1.what is React?
=>Page won't be refreshed but the content changes, so we use react.

=>The content change in react is faster than the angular so everyone uses react.

=> A JS library for user interfaces.

E.g: Facebook - dia1.jpg

2.Using React in html:

=> we can write a react app directly in html.

=>Import cdn react link in the header.
Eg: ex1.html;

2.why react?
=>React is a component based architecture.
    =>Multiple component forms a webpage.
    =>Component makes the code reusable.

=>React is declarative.
    =>Tell React what you want and react will build the actual UI.
     
    =>When the content changes, it only updates what is necessary.

NPX vs NPM:
==========

=>NPX is a npm package runner.
    ->This works without installing create-react-app but directly runs it.

=>We can use similarly use npm to do it.
    ->npm install create-react-app -g
    ->create-react-app<proj_name>

    ->But here we have to constantly update the create-react-app package.

Folder Structure:
=================

 Parent
 |-->Node Modules Dir
 |-->Public Dir
 |-->src Dir
 |-->.gitignore
 |-->package-lock.json
 |-->package.json
 |-->README.md

 Package.json:
 ->Contains dependencies and scripts of the project.

 Package-lock.json:
 ->It contains the installation of the dependencies with its url.

 node_modules(dir):
 ->It is were all the dependencies are installed.

 index.html:
  ->It contains the root div where the dev should code for the page.

Vite:
====
url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89NJdbYTgJ8&ab_channel=TraversyMedia
->Supports hot module replacement - Instant changes updated - state perserved.
->In the network tab, the source code is like the module (separately). In create-react-app, the modules are combined as bundle and embedded in index.js.

->Typescript is 20-30% percent faster in vite because it skips type skipping.

->NPM run build is used to rollup to bundle files for production.

vite vs Traditional modular bundler(webpack):
============================================

=>All the modules are bundled using webpack as a single bundle.js. So upon every change the bundle file will be reconstructed which is late.(webapp);

=>Vite uses es6 modules where <script type="modules">. It is a dev server not a modular bundler.

=>when it is time for production, it uses rollup which is a modular bundler(npm run build);

vite vs create React App:
========================

->Alternative to CRA;

How traditional bundling work? : dia2

SET-UP VITE:
============
->npm init vite <appName>

Environment variable:
====================

=>Go to root, create .env file:
like variable1=hello;

=>Go to target place, use :
{import.meta.env.variable1}//hello

=>we can use npm run build ->for building the production bundle.

=> Use npm run preview -> for running production preview.

Components:
===========

->React applications are built from isolated pieces of UI called components. A React component is a JavaScript function that you can sprinkle with markup. Components can be as small as a button, or as large as an entire page.

->The magic of component lies in their usability.
->So split the component as much as possible.

Root component:
===============

->App.jsx is the root component(starting component)

->The top-level element that is the parent of all other components in your application.

Writing markup with JSX:
========================

=>Each component is a js function that may contain some markup that react renders into the browser.
->React components use a syntax extension called jsx to represent that markup.
->Jsx is stricter than html. like all tags should be closed.class=>className, for=>htmlFor and so on(camelCase);

Rules of jsx:
1.Return a single root element:
like <> ... </>

why? 
    ->Jsx looks like html, but under the hood it is transformed into plain js objects. You can't return two objects from a function without wrapping them into an array.

2.Close all the tags:
3.camelCase most of the things.

JS in jsx with curly braces:
============================

->use js inside jsx within {...};

Rules:
->we can only use js as text or attribute value like src={title} not as a jsx tag(<{tag}>);

->JSX ultimately transpiles to js

Props:
=====

->Props/properties is an optional input that our component can accept. It also allows the component to be dynamic.

1.Pass a data into component.
2.Component process the data/manipulate.
3.return different result dynamically.

Example:
1.Enter a name into component, display the result in the browser.
refer:ex5->App.jsx

Process:
1. send the data as attribute inside the tag in the imported or destination place.
ex:<Greet name="Aslam" job="dev"></Greet>

2.Get the data in the source inside the function as parameter(here the data is in a object(any number of attributes will be encapsulated inside this object)).

Ex:
export function Greet(props){
    return(
        <>
            <h2> {"Hello "+props.name+", Job:"+props.job}</h2>
        </>
    );
}

Props.children:
=================
->In the destination(imported place), Inbetween the tags, any data(element) can be accessed inside the source.
export function Greet(props){
    return(
        <>
            <h2> {"Hello "+props.name+", Job:"+props.job}</h2>
            <h2>{props.children}</h2>
        </>
    );
}

Props with class components:
============================

->Instead of using props as function parameter, in class it implemented as this.props.*;

*.Props are immutable
=======================
